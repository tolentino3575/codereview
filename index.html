              <h4>Background</h4>
                <p>My name is Erik Tolentino. I'm 25 years old and from San Diego, CA!
                    I moved here at the end of December specifically to attend Epicodus!
                    I have a 7 year old Corgi named Winston who is very dear to me, but
                    unfortunately had to stay in San Diego. At least for the duration of
                    this program. 5 months go by faster!</p>

                <p>I have a degree in Kinesiology as I originally wanted to become a Physical
                  Therapist. Long story short, I had a major change of heart and a years worth
                  of soul searching (not really), heard about coding bootcamps, found Epicodus
                  and here I am today! It has been a week so far into the program and I am really
                  enjoying it!</p>

      <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>Below are a few of the incredibly basic pages I've made in the first week at
            Epicodus</p>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-4">
              <h4>Favorite Things</h4>
              <p>This is the first page that I created along with my partner for the day,
                Polina. In it you will find a few lists of our favorite things. Some of
                the items are clickable as well, and will link you to another page. The
                page is really rugged and messy, but this was made on just the second day!
                The page was made with HTML and utilizes basic elements such as ul, p, and
                h tags. Basic CSS was used to style things like color, font-size, font-family,
                etc.</p>
              <div class="link">
                <a href="http://tolentino3575.github.io/favoritethings/">Click me!</a>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div class="col-sm-4">
              <h4>JE Cool Cupcake Shop</h4>
              <p>This is the second page I created along with my parter, Jason. It was made
                on the third day of class. While it's still a little rugged looking, it contains
                a lot more code than the first days page. As far as HTML goes, this page now
                includes divs and classes, spans, and sidebars, and wraps. With CSS, we learned
                and applied new elements such as setting widths, floats, borders, setting heights,
                margins, etc.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-4">
              <h4>Super Magical Hawaiin Tropical Dream Vacation Getaway</h4>
              <p>This is the last page I created, along with Jacob, before starting this project.
                We made it on the fourth day of class (we're on day 5 as of typing this). It
                utilizes HTML and CSS like the pages before, but now we included the power of
                Bootstrap. Bootstrap is amazing, Bootstrap I love. We included a carousel as well
                (not to be confused with a merry-go-round). This is by far our most advanced page
                of the 3. It is still visually unappealing, but it's what's on the inside that
                counts.</p>
