              <h4>Background</h4>
                <p>My name is Erik Tolentino. I'm 25 years old and from San Diego, CA!
                    I moved here at the end of December specifically to attend Epicodus!
                    I have a 7 year old corgi who is very dear to me, but unfortunately
                    had to stay in San Diego. At least for the duration of this program.
                    5 months go by faster!!!</p>

              <h4>Edumacation</h4>
                <p>I have a degree in Kinesiology as I originally wanted to become a Physical Therapist.
                    Long story short, I had a major change of heart and a years worth of soul searching,
                    heard about coding bootcamps, found Epicodus and here I am today! It has been a week
                    so far into the program and I am really enjoying it!</p>
