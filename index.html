              <h4>Background</h4>
                <p>My name is Erik Tolentino. I'm 25 years old and from San Diego, CA!
                    I moved here at the end of December specifically to attend Epicodus!
                    I have a 7 year old corgi who is very dear to me, but unfortunately
                    had to stay in San Diego. At least for the duration of this program.
                    5 months go by faster!!!</p>

              <h4>Edumacation</h4>
                <p>I have a degree in Kinesiology as I originally wanted to become a Physical Therapist.
                    Long story short, I had a major change of heart and a years worth of soul searching,
                    heard about coding bootcamps, found Epicodus and here I am today! It has been a week
                    so far into the program and I am really enjoying it!</p>

      <h2>Past Projects:</h2>
        <p>Below are a few of the incredibly basic pages I've made in the first week</p>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-4">
              <h4>Favorite Things</h4>
              <p>This is the first page that I created along with my partner for the day, Polina.
                  In it you will find a few lists of our favorite things. Some of the items are
                  clickable as well, and will link you to another page. The page is really rugged
                  and messy, but this was made on just the second day! The page was made with HTML
                  and utilizes basic elements such as ul, p, and h tags. Basic CSS was used to style
                  things like color, font-size, font-family, etc.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-4">
              <h4>JE Cool Cupcake Shop</h4>
              <p>This is the second page I created along with my parter, Jason. It was made on the third
                  day of class. While it's still a little rugged looking, it contains a lot more code
                  than the first days page. As far as HTML goes, this page now includes divs and classes,
                  spans, and sidebars, and wraps. With CSS, we learned and applied new elements such as
                  setting widths, floats, borders, setting heights, margins, etc.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-4">
              <h4>Super Magical Hawaiin Tropical Dream Vacation Getaway</h4>
              <p>This is the last page I created, along with Jacob, before starting this project. We made
                  it on the fourth day of class (we're on day 5 as of typing this). It utilizes HTML and CSS
                  like the pages before, but now we included the power of Bootstrap. Bootstrap is amazing and
                  I love it. We included a carousel as well. This is by far our most advanced page. It still
                  is visually unappealing, but it's what's on the inside that counts.</p>
